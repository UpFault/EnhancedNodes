# EnhancedNodes

EnhancedNodes is a Minecraft plugin that adds exciting, upgrade nodes when mining ores, making your gameplay more engaging and enjoyable.

## Features

- Custom Nodes
- New Workbench

## Installation

To install this plugin click on the releases tab on the right, and click on EnhancedNodes-{VERSION}.jar, then place this into your Minecraft Servers plugin folder, ensure you also have the latest version of NBTAPI installed(https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/nbt-api.7939/)

## Usage

Explain how users can use the plugin and its various functionalities.

## Configuration

Currently there are no customization's for this, I have plans on adding a translation file so you can update the messages in the plugin to be language specific.

## Commands

There is only one command for this plugin /enhancednodes : /en

/enhancednodes help - Display's command information.
/enhancednodes info - Display's information about the plugin.
/enhancednodes panel - Display's the admin panel.

## Permissions

enhancednodes.admin is needed to use the /enhancednodes command, this is because the command only has features related to owner/admin powers.
You will need to have a permissions plugin installed unless your staff have operator, plugins like PEX(PermissionEX) or LuckPerms work with this plugin.
